# üîπ What is Threading in Python?
# Threading allows a program to run multiple tasks concurrently within the same process. It is used to improve performance when dealing with tasks that wait for external resources (like I/O operations).

# ‚úÖ Best for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file reading, API calls)
# ‚úÖ Uses threads to run tasks in parallel
# ‚úÖ Runs within a single process, so it shares memory

# üîπ Why Use Threading?
# ‚úî Speeds up I/O-bound tasks (file operations, network requests)
# ‚úî Prevents UI freezing in GUI applications
# ‚úî Efficiently handles multiple tasks at once

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Not ideal for CPU-heavy tasks (Use multiprocessing instead)
